# Emoji Video Generator

![sample script converted to video](emoji_vid_generator.gif)
The objective of this project was to develop a straightforward system capable of converting a basic script stored in a text file into a video. The aim was to ensure simplicity to the extent that even individuals with a bit of creativity and typing skills could produce a movie effortlessly. This tool is designed to operate smoothly on a computer with 8 GB of memory, offering reasonable processing speeds even without GPUs. While initially intended for entertainment with GenAI, I believe that, in capable hands, it holds the potential to generate pretty cool content. This project is experimental in nature, crafted primarily for educational purposes

## Use high quality text to image (SDXL-Turbo)(Recommended)

Create .env file if not present and add set following variable. 
Warning: You will need at least 16 GB RAM.
```bash
USE_SD_TURBO_XL=true
```

## Using high quality TTS (Bark):

Create .env file if not present and add set following variable. 
Warning: This is super slow on CPU.

```bash
TTS_HIGH_QUALITY=true
```

## Using GPU

Create .env file if not present and add set following variable

```bash
USE_CUDA=true
```

## Using pre-created assets

Ensure that asset files are present in .cache folder. Create the script in this manner

```bash
Image: .cache/existing_background_hd.png
Audio: Funny opening music jingle.
Title: EmojiVidGen
üêº: .cache/existing_speech.wav
```

## Change default width and height of image

The default resolution is 1280x720. To change it set the following environment  variables in .env file:

```bash
VIDEO_WIDTH=1152 
VIDEO_HEIGHT=896
```

Note: This setting does affect the output of stable diffusion. Not all resolutions work that well. For  more information checkout this
 https://replicate.com/guides/stable-diffusion/how-to-use/ . Stable Diffusion seems to work well with square aspect ratios.


## Known issues

You will see this error message when using default TTS engine. 

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pyttsx3/drivers/espeak.py", line 171, in _onSynth
    self._proxy.notify('finished-utterance', completed=True)
ReferenceError: weakly-referenced object no longer exists
```

Ignore this error for now as it does not affect the output.
